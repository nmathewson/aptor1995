And here's a silly old text-string store program that i did around
1995.  Was it supposed to be for storing obfuscated strings in a text
adventure?  It has a broken Vigenere cipher, for what that's worth.

I think it was supposed to build under Borland C++, judging from the
makefiles.

In any case, I can't recommend this for anything other than silly
"let's laugh at my high-school code" purposes.  But have fun!
